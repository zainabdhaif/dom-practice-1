                    Now that she's back in the atmosphere
                    With drops of Jupiter in her hair
                    She acts like summer and walks like rain
                    Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey
                    Since the return of her stay on the moon
                    She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey
                    Hey, hey, yeah
                    But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
                    Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
                    And that Heaven is overrated?
                    And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
                    One without a permanent scar, and did you miss me
                    While you were looking for yourself out there?
                    Now that she's back from that soul vacation
                    Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mmm
                    She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
                    Reminds me that there's a room to grow, hey, yeah
                </p>  
                <p>
                    Now that she's back in the atmosphere
                    I'm afraid that she might think of me as
                    Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
                    Who was too afraid to fly, so he never did land
                    But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
                    Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
                    And head back to the Milky Way?
                    And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
                    Was it everything you wanted to find, and did you miss me
                    While you were looking for yourself out there?
                    Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
                    Your best friend always sticking up for you
                    Even when I know you're wrong?
                    Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
                    Five hour phone conversation
                    The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?
